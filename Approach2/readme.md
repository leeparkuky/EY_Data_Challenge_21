# Approach 2 : When geographically and chronologically relevant training dataset is not available

### In this case, we used the logistic regression for the clear area and the linear SVC for the smoky area.

In this directory, I included both data files and ipynb files that explained what we did step-by-step.   
Please take a look at each of them in order.   

For the rotation example, the size of the train_100.csv was greater than 3.6GB, so we could not upload the data.
However, if you went through the step for generating data, you will have no trouble obtaining the same file on your computer.


Lastly, the very first step, generating the dataset from the datacube, can only be run on the Azure or docker environment provided by the host.
