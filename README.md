## **1. Introduction**
In May 2021, Maggie, Jiyeon, and I created a team to participate the EY Data Challenge and went over the tutorials provided by the host.   
Due to the constraints that we all had other commitments such as interships and research assistanship over the summer, it should be acknowledged that we 
regret that the models that will be introduced could have been better and tested whether they meet our assumptions and expectations.   
Regardless, I thank all my team members on their hard work; they deserve a great recognitions not only from others but most importantly among us.   
I enjoyed the time spent among ourselves; it was a great opportunity to build up some affinity between team members.   
I look forward to seeing Maggie and Jiyeon in Lexington in August as they arrive for the upcoming academic year.


## **2. Organization**
Mainly, there are three directories: Approach 1, Approach 2, and the GridSearchCV   
The approach 1 folder contains ipynb that explains how we made the prediction using the first approach (*overlap-and-mask*)   
The approach 2 folder contains datasets in csv and ipynb stey-by-step to explain on feature engineering and fitting the model.   
Lastly, the GridSearchCV contains the python script and the result of the models after the GridSearchCV function in scikit-learn was successfully performed.  


## **3. Notes on the binder link**
Since some of the ipynb and python scripts rely on the Azure and Docker environment set up by the host, it may not be ideal to use the binder app to test each line.   
Instead, please download the repo and run it on the same Azure or Docker environemtn provided by the host.   
The instruction for that is provided below
