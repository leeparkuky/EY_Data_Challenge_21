# The EY Data Challenge 2021 by Margaret Hughes Amissah-Mensah, Jiyeon Park, and Lee Park
### **Organization: The Dr.Bing Zhang Department of Statatics @ the University of Kentucky**


## **1. Introduction**
In May 2021, Maggie, Jiyeon, and I created a team to participate the EY Data Challenge and went over the tutorials provided by the host.   
Due to the constraints that we all had other commitments such as interships and research assistanship over the summer, it should be acknowledged that we 
regret that the models that will be introduced could have been better and tested whether they meet our assumptions and expectations.   
Regardless, I thank all my team members on their hard work; they deserve a great recognitions not only from others but most importantly among us.   
I enjoyed the time spent among ourselves; it was a great opportunity to build up some affinity between team members.   
I look forward to seeing Maggie and Jiyeon in Lexington in August as they arrive for the upcoming academic year.
